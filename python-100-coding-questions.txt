# 100+ Python challenging programming exercises for Python 3

## 1. Level description
### Level 1	Beginner 
Beginner means someone who has just gone through an introductory Python course. He can solve some problems with 1 or 2 Python classes or functions. Normally, the answers could directly be found in the textbooks.

### Level 2	Intermediate 
Intermediate means someone who has just learned Python, but already has a relatively strong programming background from before. He should be able to solve problems which may involve 3 or 3 Python classes or functions. The answers cannot be directly be found in the textbooks.

### Level 3	Advanced. 
He should use Python to solve more complex problem using more rich libraries functions and data structures and algorithms. He is supposed to solve the problem using several Python standard packages and advanced techniques.

### Question 1
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Solution:
```python
l=[]
for i in range(2000, 3201):
    if (i%7==0) and (i%5!=0):
        l.append(str(i))

print(','.join(l))
```

Use isalpha() and isdigit().

Solution:
```
s = input()
letters = 0
digits = 0

for ch in s:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += 1
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += 1

print("Letters:", letters)
print("Digits:", digits)
```

### Question 7
Level 2 (Moderate – Interview Question)

Question:
Write a program to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

Hints:
Compare the string with its reverse.

Solution:
```
s = input()

if s == s[::-1]:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not Palindrome")
```

### Question 8
Level 2 (Moderate)

Question:
Write a program to remove duplicate values from a list.

Hints:
Use a set or loop.

Solution:
```
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
unique = list(set(l))

print(unique)
```

### Question 9
Level 2 (Moderate – Interview Favorite)

Question:
Write a program to find the largest and smallest number in a list.

Hints:
Use built-in functions or loop.

Solution:
```
l = list(map(int, input().split()))

print("Largest:", max(l))
print("Smallest:", min(l))
```

### Question 10
Level 3 (Moderate – Important Interview Question)

Question:
Write a program to find Fibonacci series up to n terms.

Hints:
Use iteration.

Solution:
```
n = int(input())
a, b = 0, 1

for i in range(n):
    print(a, end=" ")
    a, b = b, a+b
```

### Question 11
Level 3 (Moderate – Interview Coding Question)

Question:
Write a program to check whether a number is prime.

Hints:
Check divisibility up to square root.

Solution:
```
n = int(input())
flag = True

if n <= 1:
    flag = False
else:
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            flag = False
            break

if flag:
    print("Prime")
