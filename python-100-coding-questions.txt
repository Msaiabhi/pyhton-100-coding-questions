Question 12

Level: Easy

Question:
Write a program to find the maximum of three numbers.

Hints:
Use conditional statements.

Solution:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

if a >= b and a >= c:
    print(a)
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(c)

Question 13

Level: Easy

Question:
Write a program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Hints:
Use if–elif–else.

Solution:

n = int(input())

if n > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif n < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

Question 14

Level: Easy–Moderate

Question:
Write a program to find the length of a string without using len().

Hints:
Use a loop.

Solution:

s = input()
count = 0

for _ in s:
    count += 1

print(count)

Question 15

Level: Moderate (Interview Question)

Question:
Write a program to find the sum of digits of a number.

Hints:
Use loop and modulo.

Solution:

n = int(input())
total = 0

while n > 0:
    total += n % 10
    n //= 10

print(total)

Question 16

Level: Moderate

Question:
Write a program to generate a list of even numbers up to n.

Hints:
Use loop and condition.

Solution:

n = int(input())
evens = []

for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(i)

print(evens)

Question 17

Level: Moderate (Interview Favorite)

Question:
Write a program to check whether a number is an Armstrong number.

Hints:
Sum of digits raised to power of number of digits.

Solution:

n = int(input())
temp = n
power = len(str(n))
total = 0

while temp > 0:
    digit = temp % 10
    total += digit ** power
    temp //= 10

if total == n:
    print("Armstrong Number")
else:
    print("Not an Armstrong Number")

Question 18

Level: Moderate

Question:
Write a program to find the common elements between two lists.

Hints:
Use set intersection.

Solution:

l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
l2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

common = list(set(l1) & set(l2))
print(common)
